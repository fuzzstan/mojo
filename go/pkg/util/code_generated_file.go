	// file.  This allows the generator to break large files into small chunks,
	// and allows the generated text to be streamed back to protoc so that large
	// files need not reside completely in memory at one time.  Note that as of
	// this writing protoc does not optimize for this -- it will read the entire
	// CodeGeneratorResponse before writing files to disk.
